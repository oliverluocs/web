<h2>History</h2>
    
<p>Evidence of the first lamps used by early humans dates back to 70,000BC. They were of simple structure - just a shell or a hollow rock, which held a piece of moss soaked in animal fat that burned with a flame.</p>
<p>Along with the progress of the Industrial Revolution, gas lighting was discovered by William Murdoch. He worked for Matthew Boulton and James Watt at their Soho Foundry steam engine works in Birmingham, England. In the early 1790s, while overseeing the use of his company's steam engines in tin mining in Cornwall, Murdoch began experimenting with various types of gas, finally settling on coal gas as the most effective. </p>
<p>In 1879 Edison set out to invent a long-lasting electric light bulb that could compete with gas lighting. His first successful prototype was on October 22, 1879 when his incandescent light burned for 13 and a half hours. Thomas A. Edison's lamp became the first commercially successful incandescent lamp (circa 1879).</p>
<p>Incandescent bulbs would go on to dominate the world of lighting until fluorescent lights were introduced commercially by Daniel McFarlan Moore in 1904. One difference between mercury vapor and fluorescent lamps is that fluorescent bulbs are coated on the inside to increase efficiency.</p>
