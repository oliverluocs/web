    <h2>Lamps Personified</h2>
<p>One of the most famous examples of lamps being personified is in Pixar. The Pixar mascot originated from Luxo Jr., a 1986 American computer-animated short film produced and released by Pixar in 1986. Luxo Jr. is regarded as a breakthrough in the animation industry as a whole, changing traditionalists' interpretation of computer animation. The short was the first work of animation to use procedural animation, the software written by Eben Ostby. It received an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Short Film, becoming the first CGI film nominated for an Academy Award. </p>
